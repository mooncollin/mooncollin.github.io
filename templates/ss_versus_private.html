    <h2 class="article-header">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        We investigated the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) programs
        within the Social Security Administration for their benefits and sustainability to eligible participants. We
        contrast these benefits to products offered by private products to create a cost-benefit analysis based on
        income levels. Our analysis finds that while using private-only solutions to Social Security, 104 scenarios
        were tested, and only 6.45% survived an equivalent withdrawal rate that matched the corresponding Social Security
        Old-Age benefits.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">What is Social Security?</h2>
    <p>
        Social Security is a welfare program in the United States. It was first established in 1939 to
        provide private life insurance for families which lost their head of household. After 1939, several
        additions to the Social Security program were added to provide additional benefits for the disabled,
        health needs, and supplemental income for the retired elderly. This program today serves 1 in 5
        Americans, which is about 63 million beneficiaries.
    </p>

    <h2 class="article-header">How is Social Security Financed?</h2>
    <p>
        Social Security is financed through a payroll tax. Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of gross wages
        up to a taxable maximum of $160,200, while the self-employed pay the full 12.4%.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, $841.38 billion (92.6%) of total Old-Age and Survivors Insurance came from payroll taxes. The
        remainder income was interest earnings of $67.47 billion (7.4%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, $142.37 billion (98.1%) of total Disability Insurance came from payroll taxes. The remainder
        income was interest earnings of $2.64 billion (1.9%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">What are the costs of Social Security?</h2>
    <p>
        In 2021, net costs for monthly benefits for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance were $997.93 billion
        (99.5%), while net administration costs were $4.01 billion (0.5%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, net costs for monthly benefits for Disability Insurance were $140.62 billion (98.3%), while net
        administration costs were $2.48 billion (1.7%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <p>
        In both accounts, inflows of payroll taxes funds make up almost all revenues. With a 1.9% (OASI) and 1%
        (DI) adjusted interest yield, income from investing activities makes up very little to the revenues of the
        program. Administrators of this program have a focus on sustaining inflows into the trust rather than
        using the funds' capital itself to grow revenue.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Social Security Operations</h2>
    <h3 class="article-header">Eligibility for Old-Age and Survivors Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        An individual is eligible for Old-Age benefits once they are 62 years or older and have worked and paid Social
        Security taxes for at least 10 years (SSA). Those eligible for Old-Age but making more than $56,520 in
        taxable income will have their benefits reduced by $1 for every $3 over the limit. Those eligible for
        Survivor's but making more than $21,240 in taxable income will have their benefits reduced by $1 for
        every $2 over the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        One can earn a maximum of four credits each year, with a total of 40 credits to qualify for benefits. For
        2023, each credit costs $1,640.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent reports show that benefits will need to be cut by about 24.9% by 2034 to keep the program from
        becoming insolvent (2022 SSA Annual Report). We assume in our analysis that this action is to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Survivors' insurance lasts differently depending on the beneficiaries
        <ul>
            <li>Widows and Widowers</li>
            <p>Lasts for life, starting at 60 - or 50 if disabled, or unless Old-Age payments are larger.</p>
            <li>Mothers and Fathers</li>
            <p>Lasts until they no longer have a dependent child younger than 16, or retirement age.</p>
            <li>Children</li>
            <p>Until the child turns 18.</p>
            <li>Parents</li>
            <p>Lasts for life, starting at 62, if the deceased worker supported at least half support.</p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Eligibility for Disability Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        The Social Security Administration determines whether you qualify for disability insurance based on
        internal review. Although this review is on a per-case basis, the SSA does give some guidelines to their
        process (SSA):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The disability significantly limits your ability to do basic work activities - such as lifting,
            standing, walking, sitting, and remembering - for at least 12 months. If so then,
        </li>
        <li>
            A panel of experts finds if the disability matches a listing of disabilities and severities. If the
            experts agree that the disability and severity both match a current listing of disabilities and
            severities then,
        </li>
        <li>
            The administration determines if the disability limits the ability to do any of past work
            experiences. If so then,
        </li>
        <li>
            The administration determines if there exists any other kind of work that could be done
            regardless of the disability. If so, then disability insurance is granted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Disability benefits are not eligible for those currently confined for a crime, not standing trial, or
        registered as not guilty by reason of insanity caused by mental illness. Those eligible from a disability
        and able to work but making more than $1,470 per month ($17,640 in taxable income annually) are
        ineligible to continue benefits (SSA). Approximately 63% of all disability claims are denied (SSA, 2018).
    </p>
    <p>
        Disability insurance pays for as long as you're disabled, but will stop once retirement age is achieved, in
        which Old-Age benefits take over.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Private Options</h2>
    <h3 class="article-header">Old-Age Equivalent</h3>
    <p>
        Equivalent products to Old-Age Social Security Insurance could be a:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>401K</li>
        <li>IRA</li>
        <li>Taxable Brokerage</li>
        <li>Annuity</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="article-header">401K</h4>
    <p>
        A 401K is a tax-sheltered retirement account. This account is funded by pre-tax employment income,
        which reduces overall taxable income. In 2023, contributions are limited to $22,500. The account funds
        can be withdrawn at age 59&#189; without penalty, with its withdrawals counting as income.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">IRA</h4>
    <p>
        A traditional IRA is similar to a 401K, but is used by those who do not have an employer sponsored 401K
        plan. Contributions are limited to $6,500.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Roth IRA is funded by post-tax employment income. In 2023, contributions are limited to $6,500. The
        account funds can be withdrawn at age 59&#189; without penalty, with its withdrawals being tax-free.
        Withdrawals on principle can happen any time without penalty. There are income limits to contributing
        to this account.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">Taxable Brokerage</h4>
    <p>
        A taxable brokerage is an investment account that can be funded by any post-tax contributions. There
        are no income limits, contribution limits, withdrawal limits or penalties. Short-term gains and non-
        qualified dividends are recognized as income, while long-term gains and qualified dividends are taxed as
        capital gains.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">Annuity</h4>
    <p>
        Annuities are financial products which guarantee a certain amount of monthly income. These often
        require an up-front cost, and provide income for a certain number of years, often sold at various yields.
    </p>
    <p>
        We refrain from mentioning and analyzing pension plans, as those products are not guarantees and
        ownership of retirement savings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our analysis will use a brokerage account for the retirement savings. This analysis does not consider
        taxes from investing activities, but our numbers do assume an after-tax contribution. Pre-tax
        contribution accounts may have higher end portfolios than our analysis.
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Survivors Insurance Equivalent</h3>
    <p>Equivalent products to Survivors Social Security Insurance would be private term life insurance.</p>
    <p>
        Private term life insurance pays immediately after death, so it is not exactly equivalent to Survivors
        Insurance, but this should be regarded as a benefit to the private product.
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Disability Insurance Equivalent</h3>
    <p>
        Equivalent products to Disability Social Security Insurance would be private long-term and short-term
        disability insurance.
    </p>
    <p>Private disability insurance pays immediately after a disability, and comes in two forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Short-term</li>
        <li>Long-term</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since Social Security Disability Insurance pays for as long as one is disabled, we will use long-term
        disability insurance as our private product of choice.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Eliminating Social Security</h2>
    <p>
        This analysis assumes an elimination of Social Security taxes and those tax dollars to go back into wages.
        An elimination of the Social Security program will eliminate these taxes and administrative costs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>12.4% of employees and employer shared wage costs, assumed to go to back into wages.</li>
        <li>0.5% OASI administrative costs.</li>
        <li>1.7% DI administrative costs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will not explore administrative cost savings related to employers not needing to collect these taxes.</p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Main Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Our analysis will compare Social Security monthly income benefits against a well-structured set of
        private products across age and income sets. This way we can see the impact on sooner versus later
        savings and lower versus higher income individuals. We will assume a retirement age of 62 for our
        calculations, as that is the minimum to receive benefits for Social Security.
    </p>
    <p>
        This analysis will not make claims on whether benefits are sufficient for a given age, but rather find
        private solutions that match benefits best.
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Old-Age Monthly Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        We assume a worker starts at a given age, making a given amount of earnings until retirement at age 62. All
        numbers calculated using the Social Security Benefit Calculator (SS Calculator). It should be noted that
        the Age column represents those who started working (paying into Social Security) at that age, not those
        who are currently at that age.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to insolvency of Old-Age benefits in 2034 and official reporting to its solutions, we will assume
        retirements after 2035 have their benefits cut by 24.9%.

    <p class="figure-footer">Table 4: Extra wages from excluding Social Security</p>
    <p>
        The extra earnings will be used to create a similar scenario to Social Security Old-Age Insurance,
        Disability Insurance, and Survivors Insurance. We will first find private insurance products for both
        Disability Insurance and Survivors Insurance that match the benefits for each age group. Any leftover
        wages will be put into a 401K/Taxable Brokerage as eligible to match benefits at 62. Any wages left over
        after retirement accounts will be placed into a Taxable Brokerage account. This analysis will not include
        an IRA portion, as those solutions are more complex.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">Private Life Insurance (SS Survivors Insurance)</h4>
    <p>
        These numbers were gathered from Fidelity (Fidelity Investments). Our estimates assume the following
        characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Male</li>
        <li>5' 10"</li>
        <li>Non-smoker</li>
        <li>Average Health</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We use term life insurance for at most 20 years or the number of years until retirement, whichever is
        less. We use a coverage amount that would last 30 years (the equivalent length of Survivors Insurance)
        of the monthly benefit of the corresponding Survivors benefit.

    <p>
        Now that our insurance needs are met, we will use the 401K solution for retirement. We will use a
        target date fund that matches a retirement age of 62. These funds start out by investing in higher return
        assets and over its lifetime will transition into a more conservative portfolio by retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Target date funds are offered by many companies, such as Vanguard. Vanguard's target date funds use a glide
        path from start to decades after retirement. Here is an example of a glide path in Vanguard's target date fund
        prospectus:
    </p>
    <img src="images/target_date_glide.png">
    <p>
        We will use Portfolio Visualizer to set up a Monte Carlo simulation of these asset classes across the lifetime of the individual and
        into retirement to get the most accurate depication of their portfolio balances.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following asset classes and their percentages will be used in the simulation:
    </p>
    <p>Before Retirement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>54% US Stocks</li>
        <li>36% Foreign Stocks</li>
        <li>7% US Fixed Income</li>
        <li>3% Foreign Fixed Income</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At Retirement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>30% US Stocks</li>
        <li>20% Foreign Stocks</li>
        <li>35% US Fixed Income</li>
        <li>15% Foreign Fixed Income</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Asset class percentages will be interpolated between 25 years before retirement and the retirement date.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we take out the corresponding Social Security Old-Age benefits from each portfolio balance (accounting for inflation/COL adjustments), this is the
        chance of survival after 30 years of retirement:

    <p><small>N/A - There is not a corresponding Social Security benefit to compare</small></p>
    <p>
        In our scenarios, 6.45% of all portfolios succeed in competing against Social Security Old-Age withdrawals.
        These scenarios are based on incomes not changing as one ages.
    </p>
    <p>In 2021, these were the current medium household income by age:</p>

    <p class="figure-footer">Figure 1: Median Household Income in the U.S. in 2021 (Statista)</p>
    <p>
        Since median income changes as one ages, we can use this to create a more meaningful example
        of the median individual. We will use the median incomes in each age group from age 25 to 62
        to calculate Social Security benefits and compare against the private options.
    </p>
    <p>
        We start with a median income of $74,862 at age 25, then increase income by 2% per year until
        age 62. This gives us an Old-Age monthly benefit of $8,233. The Survivor benefit in case
        of disability would be $2,144.10.
    </p>
    <p>
        An elimination of Social Security would increase the $74,862 wages by $9,282.88, which is $773.57 per month.
        We'll use the $80,000 bracket for private life and disability insurance costs, summing up to $137.30 per month.
        This gives us $636.27 to invest, which will increase by 2% per year, until age 62.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Monte Carlo simulation gives this portfolio an 8.64% chance of survival; only slightly better than the median
        portfolio of 6.45% across all ages and incomes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Our analysis shows that out of 104 Social Security benefit scenarios, 93.55% of portfolios do not achieve a full 30-year
        retirement based on distributed Social Security benefits.
