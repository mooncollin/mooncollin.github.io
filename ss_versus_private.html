    <h2 class="mt-4 article-header">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        We investigated the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) programs
        within the Social Security Administration for their benefits and sustainability to eligible participants. We
        contrast these benefits to products offered by private products to create a cost-benefit analysis based on
        income levels and age. Our analysis shows that out of 96 Social Security benefit income-age scenarios, 67 (70%) scenarios do not achieve a full 30-year
        retirement based on distributed Social Security benefits. On ages 25-35, we see less than half are able to obtain an adequate portfolio.
        For ages 40-45, around 5% are able to succeed with a private option. For ages 50 and above, no income can sustain a portfolio able to
        withdraw equivalent Social Security benefits.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">What is Social Security?</h2>
    <p>
        Social Security is a welfare program in the United States. It was first established in 1939 to
        provide private life insurance for families which lost their head of household. After 1939, several
        additions to the Social Security program were added to provide additional benefits for the disabled,
        health needs, and supplemental income for the retired elderly. This program today serves 1 in 5
        Americans, which is about 63 million beneficiaries.
    </p>
    <img src="images/ss_history.png">
    <h2 class="article-header">How is Social Security Financed?</h2>
    <p>
        Social Security is financed through a payroll tax. Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of gross wages
        up to a taxable maximum of $160,200, while the self-employed pay the full 12.4%.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, $841.38 billion (92.6%) of total Old-Age and Survivors Insurance came from payroll taxes. The
        remainder income was interest earnings of $67.47 billion (7.4%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, $142.37 billion (98.1%) of total Disability Insurance came from payroll taxes. The remainder
        income was interest earnings of $2.64 billion (1.9%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">What are the costs of Social Security?</h2>
    <p>
        In 2021, net costs for monthly benefits for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance were $997.93 billion
        (99.5%), while net administration costs were $4.01 billion (0.5%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, net costs for monthly benefits for Disability Insurance were $140.62 billion (98.3%), while net
        administration costs were $2.48 billion (1.7%) (2022 SSA Annual Report).
    </p>
    <p>
        In both accounts, inflows of payroll taxes funds make up almost all revenues. With a 1.9% (OASI) and 1%
        (DI) adjusted interest yield, income from investing activities makes up very little to the revenues of the
        program. Administrators of this program have a focus on sustaining inflows into the trust rather than
        using the funds' capital itself to grow revenue.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Social Security Operations</h2>
    <h3 class="article-header">Eligibility for Old-Age and Survivors Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        An individual is eligible for Old-Age benefits once they are 62 years or older and have worked and paid Social
        Security taxes for at least 10 years (SSA). Those eligible for Old-Age but making more than $56,520 in
        taxable income will have their benefits reduced by $1 for every $3 over the limit. Those eligible for
        Survivor's but making more than $21,240 in taxable income will have their benefits reduced by $1 for
        every $2 over the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        One can earn a maximum of four credits each year, with a total of 40 credits to qualify for benefits. For
        2023, each credit costs $1,640.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent reports show that benefits will need to be cut by about 24.9% by 2034 to keep the program from
        becoming insolvent (2022 SSA Annual Report). We assume in our analysis that this action is to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Survivors' insurance lasts differently depending on the beneficiaries
        <ul>
            <li>Widows and Widowers</li>
            <p>Lasts for life, starting at 60 - or 50 if disabled, or unless Old-Age payments are larger.</p>
            <li>Mothers and Fathers</li>
            <p>Lasts until they no longer have a dependent child younger than 16, or retirement age.</p>
            <li>Children</li>
            <p>Until the child turns 18.</p>
            <li>Parents</li>
            <p>Lasts for life, starting at 62, if the deceased worker supported at least half support.</p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Eligibility for Disability Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        The Social Security Administration determines whether you qualify for disability insurance based on
        internal review. Although this review is on a per-case basis, the SSA does give some guidelines to their
        process (SSA):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The disability significantly limits your ability to do basic work activities - such as lifting,
            standing, walking, sitting, and remembering - for at least 12 months. If so then,
        </li>
        <li>
            A panel of experts finds if the disability matches a listing of disabilities and severities. If the
            experts agree that the disability and severity both match a current listing of disabilities and
            severities then,
        </li>
        <li>
            The administration determines if the disability limits the ability to do any of past work
            experiences. If so then,
        </li>
        <li>
            The administration determines if there exists any other kind of work that could be done
            regardless of the disability. If so, then disability insurance is granted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Disability benefits are not eligible for those currently confined for a crime, not standing trial, or
        registered as not guilty by reason of insanity caused by mental illness. Those eligible from a disability
        and able to work but making more than $1,470 per month ($17,640 in taxable income annually) are
        ineligible to continue benefits (SSA). Approximately 63% of all disability claims are denied (SSA, 2018).
    </p>
    <p>
        Disability insurance pays for as long as you're disabled, but will stop once retirement age is achieved, in
        which Old-Age benefits take over.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Private Options</h2>
    <h3 class="article-header">Old-Age Equivalent</h3>
    <p>
        There are various account types that can be used for retirement:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>401K</li>
        <li>IRA</li>
        <li>Taxable Brokerage</li>
        <li>Annuity</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="article-header">401K</h4>
    <p>
        A 401K is a tax-sheltered retirement account. This account is funded by pre-tax employment income,
        which reduces overall taxable income. In 2023, contributions are limited to $22,500. The account funds
        can be withdrawn at age 59&#189; without penalty, with its withdrawals counting as income.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">IRA</h4>
    <p>
        A traditional IRA is similar to a 401K, but is used by those who do not have an employer sponsored 401K
        plan. Contributions are limited to $6,500.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Roth IRA is funded by post-tax employment income. In 2023, contributions are limited to $6,500. The
        account funds can be withdrawn at age 59&#189; without penalty, with its withdrawals being tax-free.
        Withdrawals on principle can happen any time without penalty. There are income limits to contributing
        to this account.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">Taxable Brokerage</h4>
    <p>
        A taxable brokerage is an investment account that can be funded by any post-tax contributions. There
        are no income limits, contribution limits, withdrawal limits or penalties. Short-term gains and non-
        qualified dividends are recognized as income, while long-term gains and qualified dividends are taxed as
        capital gains.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">Annuity</h4>
    <p>
        Annuities are financial products which guarantee a certain amount of monthly income. These often
        require an up-front cost, and provide income for a certain number of years, often sold at various yields.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our analysis will attempt to pick the best match for the need of each scenario. This analysis does not
        consider taxes from account withdrawals. Everyone's tax situation is different.
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Survivors Insurance Equivalent</h3>
    <p>Equivalent products to Survivors Social Security Insurance would be private term life insurance.</p>
    <p>
        Private term life insurance pays immediately after death, so it is not exactly equivalent to Survivors
        Insurance, but this should be regarded as a benefit to the private product.
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Disability Insurance Equivalent</h3>
    <p>
        Equivalent products to Disability Social Security Insurance would be private long-term and short-term
        disability insurance.
    </p>
    <p>Private disability insurance pays immediately after a disability, and comes in two forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Short-term</li>
        <li>Long-term</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since Social Security Disability Insurance pays for as long as one is disabled, we will use long-term
        disability insurance as our private product of choice.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Eliminating Social Security</h2>
    <p>
        This analysis assumes an elimination of Social Security taxes and those tax dollars to go back into wages.
        An elimination of the Social Security program will eliminate these taxes and administrative costs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>12.4% of employees and employer shared wage costs, assumed to go to back into wages.</li>
        <li>0.5% OASI administrative costs.</li>
        <li>1.7% DI administrative costs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will not explore administrative cost savings related to employers not needing to collect these taxes.</p>
    <h2 class="article-header">Main Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Our analysis will compare Social Security monthly income benefits against a well-structured set of
        private products across age and income sets. This way we can see the impact on sooner versus later
        savings and lower versus higher income individuals. We will assume a retirement age of 62 for our
        calculations, as that is the minimum to receive benefits for Social Security.
    </p>
    <p>
        This analysis will not make claims on whether benefits are sufficient for a given age, but rather find
        private solutions that match benefits best.
    </p>
    <h3 class="article-header">Old-Age Monthly Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        We assume a worker starts at a given age, making a given amount of earnings until retirement at age 62. All
        numbers calculated using the Social Security Benefit Calculator (SS Calculator). It should be noted that
        the Age column represents those who started working (paying into Social Security) at that age, not those
        who are currently at that age. These numbers are inflation adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to insolvency of Old-Age benefits in 2034 and official reporting to its solutions, we will assume
        retirements after 2035 have their benefits cut by 24.9%.

    <p>
        The extra earnings will be used to create a similar scenario to Social Security Old-Age Insurance,
        Disability Insurance, and Survivors Insurance. We will first find private insurance products for both
        Disability Insurance and Survivors Insurance that match the benefits for each age group. Any leftover
        wages will be put into a 401K/Taxable Brokerage as eligible to match benefits at 62. Any wages left over
        after retirement accounts will be placed into a Taxable Brokerage account. This analysis will not include
        an IRA portion, as those solutions are more complex.
    </p>
    <h4 class="article-header">Private Life Insurance (SS Survivors Insurance)</h4>
    <p>
        These numbers were gathered from Fidelity (Fidelity Investments). Our estimates assume the following
        characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Male</li>
        <li>5' 10"</li>
        <li>Non-smoker</li>
        <li>Average Health</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We use term life insurance for at most 20 years or the number of years until retirement, whichever is
        less. We use a coverage amount that would last 30 years (the equivalent length of Survivors Insurance)
        of the monthly benefit of the corresponding Survivors benefit.

    <h4 class="article-header">Retirement</h4>
    <p>
        Our retirement analysis will simulate Social Security Old-Age Benefits income, coming from private solutions. To find
        what private solution would work best, we find a rate of return in that allows us to withdraw equivalent
        income that lasts for 30 years. For each income range, we will simulate depositing the extra wages into a value-generating account,
        and then at retirement age of 62, we will withdraw from this account for 30 years.

        Using an <a href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/efficient-frontier?s=y&sl=4FBsMrR6bvI3HS2o3UPpQq">Efficient Frontier calcuation</a> from Portfolio Visualizer, we can find which sets of portfolios give us
        pairs of annual expected returns and their volatilities.

        Using the data, we can estimate how much of the population would be able to switch to a private system, while keeping similar benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
        For age 25, one needs an income of at least $35,000 to qualify. Since we only have data points for 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90%, we'll interpolate
        the rest. We'll use this kind of analysis on all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using trendline analysis, we get the following equations for each age, where <code>x</code> is the percentile and <code>y</code> is the income:
        <ul>
            <li>Age 25: <code>y = 16110e<sup>1.7643x</sup></code></li>
            <li>Age 30: <code>y = 18043e<sup>1.9499x</sup></code></li>

        With the above equations, we can plug in our lowest income that has an existing portfolio into <code>y</code>, and solve for <code>x</code>. This will
        give us the percentage of individuals in that age group that meet at least those incomes.
        <ul>
            <li>Age 25, $35,000:  35.24%
            <li>Age 30, $60,000:  38.38%
            <li>Age 35, $80,000:  31.00%
            <li>Age 40, $150,000: 2.57%
            <li>Age 45, $160,200: 5.15%
        </ul>

    <h2 class="article-header">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Our analysis shows that out of 96 Social Security benefit income-age scenarios, 67 (70%) scenarios do not achieve a full 30-year
        retirement based on distributed Social Security benefits. On ages 25-35, we see less than half are able to obtain an adequate portfolio.
        For ages 40-45, around 5% are able to succeed with a private option. For ages 50 and above, no income can sustain a portfolio able to
        withdraw equivalent Social Security benefits.
